Story:-
WAR GAMES
World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that involved
virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45. The
principal belligerents were the Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and
Japan—and the Allies—France, Great Britain, the United States, the
Soviet Union.. The war was in many respects a continuation, after an
uneasy 20-year hiatus, of the disputes left unsettled by World War I.
By the early part of 1939 the German dictator Adolf Hitler had become
determined to invade and occupy Poland. Poland, for its part, had
guarantees of French and British military support should it be attacked
by Germany. Hitler intended to invade Poland, which was a direct
threat to the western powers, but the Allies had no clue about it, as the
German forces relayed important messages through “Enigma”, a
cipher device created by them. This posed a lot of problems to the
Allies, as they had no clue about Hitler’s strategies. Only a
death-defying mission, which was to capture the platoon transporting
the “Enigma” could increase the odds of the Allies winning the war.
Luckily, the mission was a success. The first step towards a greater
goal was accomplished. But this wasn’t the end…it was merely the
beginning…
Mission * :
Update from base- we have captured the german platoon responsible
for transporting “Enigma”. The Enigma machine is a cipher device
developed and used by Germans to protect commercial, diplomatic,
and military communication. It is a keyboard that scrambled messages
in a way that could only be unscrambled by someone using an
identical machine with identical settings somewhere else. The
machine looked like a typewriter, but instead of typing out letters on a
sheet of paper, it had a board of lights with one light for each
numerical value. As the operator typed each number of their message
into the machine, a value on the board would light up to produce a
scrambled message. Their seemingly unbreakable encrypted
messages would direct army movements, aircraft raids, and the
deadly U-boat submarines that terrorized Allied military and civilian
ships on both sides of the Atlantic. Cracking the Enigma machine is
key to gaining an advantage in WWII. Your mission, should you
choose to accept, is to find the encryption key for the device in our
possession and help us end this war for good. Further updates from
Base will soon follow. Stay Alert Over and out
Base: The machine is in working condition. Our scientists tried to
operate it, using a signal receiver. This is what we have obtained so
far. On initial observation, our analysts believe there is a certain
pattern being hidden by this machine. Your objective is to find the
pattern and report back for further instructions. Over and out
Base: The signals dont make sense. It is highly improbable that the
Germans are just broadcasting gibberish/ noise everywhere. There
must be a hidden key that can help us to decipher the message.
According to our insider sources who have managed to infiltrate the
inner circle of our enemies, the key to the enigma machine changes
periodically. The key changes after every 4 attempts. After the 4th
attempt, enigma changes the position of its rotors i.e the key changes.
Keeping this in mind, your task is to find the encryption key within the
limit of attempts given. Remember soldier, we are racing against time
here, tread carefully. A Single mistake, we start from scratch.
Base: Once we successfully identified the German military
strongholds, we will deploy the Allied troops. They’ll carry out God’s
justice. May the lord have mercy on our enemies. The Germans might
be alerted of our advances soon. We must invade and capture our
enemies before they get a chance to retaliate. Your objective now is to
find the best possible route for our forces, so that we won’t be
attacked by our enemies before we capture all the bases.


INSTRUCTIONS TO BE FOLLOWED:-
  1. Execute the enigma file to interact with enigma. To do so, extract the zip file
given, and then run the “enigma.exe” file in the current directory.
  2. The contestants need to find the key for all 4 quadrants in order to obtain all the
coordinates.
  3. Each key for a question combined with signals gives the coordinates of places in
its respective quadrant.
  4. The contestant is given 4 tries to guess the correct key constraint for a given
question.
  5. The keys must be inputted as space separated integers.
  6. Key constraints:-
    a. Zero is not a valid number in the key.
    b. The range of valid numbers is 1 to 16.
    c. The operation required to obtain the key are:-
      i. Logical “AND” of the 0th and the 2nd index of the key must be
      equal to the logical “XOR” of the 1st and 3rd index.
      ii. The logical “XOR” of the 1st and 3rd index must not be equal to
      zero.
    d. The key cannot be unique, i.e all the digits of the key can’t be distinct.
    The correct key will have repeated digits. For example:-
    (7, 4, 6, 2) is an invalid key.
    (6, 4, 6, 2) is a valid key.
  7. After each try, enigma will display the correctness of the digits in the key.
Correct digit and correct position- “2”
Wrong digit - “0”
Correct digit, but at the wrong position - “1”
  8. If the contestant fails to obtain the key within the allowed guesses, the key will
reset. Hence you will start from the beginning.
  9. For the second part of the question, head to the link below.

  10.In the above interface, A 4 digit key and 12 digit signal will be required as input,
and the coordinates will be presented.
  11. Use the coordinates to solve the second part of the question.
  12.The answer is expected in a visual format. Any open-source Graphing tool can be
used. The best path from the starting coordinate taken must be clearly indicated
in the Graph along with the coordinates. The graph with the path highlighted must
be presented, and the minimum distance should be calculated
